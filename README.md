# CDADM-
## Built With
* [Python]
* [Pytorch]
  
## Code  
The code from the paper "A Cross-dimensional Attention Discriminating Masked Method For Building Energy Time-series Data Imputation".

## Dataset  
you can direct testing of CDADM on the BDG2 and ele datasets. The BDG2 data is provided, and the ele dataset can be downloaded from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/321/electricityloaddiagrams20112014.
